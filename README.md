## Summary
The amount of employees nearing their retirement age is very high and will need to have an action plan. If it is not planned out properly, this could cause a huge disturbance to the company as many could leave at the same time leaving gaps in different departments. 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There will be a total of over 72 thousand employees which will be needed to fill in after the "silver tsumani" is over. In the chart below it shows the top ten titles and their respective departments which will need to be filled in. Please see "Deliverable 3" to see how this chart was created.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There seems like there will not be enough employees who are qualified for the mentorship program. As shown in the chart below, there are 569 eligible Senior Staff on the program but will need to fill in 25,915 roles. There is a significantly smaller amount of qualified employees to mentor the new generation. They may need to use a higher range of birth dates.
